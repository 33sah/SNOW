For both graphs, a logarithmic model $f(x) = a + b*log(x)$ was used as a starting point to fit the data. A logarithmic relationship seemed fitting from the shape of our data. This relationship was also suggested by previous research regarding Spallation.
As for the process of curve fitting itself, Scipy.optimise.curveFit was used to determine parameters a,b.
